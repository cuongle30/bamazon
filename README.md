**Will show available products and prompt users with two messages:**

•	The first will ask them the SKU of the product they would like to buy.

•	The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

**(Once the customer has placed the order, the app will check for available quantity)**

•	If not, the app will log “Not enough” and then prevent the order from going through.

•	If there is enough, the order will be processed and stock will be updated
