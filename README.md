Bamazon Customer App 
Will show available products and prompt users with two messages:
•	The first will ask them the SKU of the product they would like to buy.
•	The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the request.
•	If not, the app will log “Not enough” and then prevent the order from going through.
•	If there is enough, the order will be processed and stock will be updated
Bamazon Manager App
Will list a set of menu options:
•	View Products for Sale
•	View Low Inventory
•	Add to Inventory
•	Add New Product
What it will do:
•	If a manager selects View Products for Sale, the app will list every available item: the item SKUs, names, prices, and quantities.
•	If a manager selects View Low Inventory, the app will list all items with an inventory count lower than 5.
•	If a manager selects Add to Inventory, the app will display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.
•	If a manager selects Add New Product, it should allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.
